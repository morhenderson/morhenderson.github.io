                <h2>Filtering Algorithms</h2>
                <p>
                    I first learned about Kalman filters in a graduate level course titled "Statistical Estimation for Dynamical 
                    Systems". Later I served as teaching assistant for the course and took an advanced section that dove deeper 
                    into the theory and included Bayesian, particle, and other filter methods.
                </p>

                    <p class="bm">
                        As TA for the Statistical Estimation course, I decided to write a basic but thorough tutorial on the
                        standard Kalman Filter (including truth modeling) applied to a simple linear dynamical system. It includes a 
                        Python program (Buffmo.py) and a comprehensive writeup (Buffmo.pdf) covering the mathematical formulation of
                        the problem and detailed descriptions of the program.

                        After my semester as TA, I was impressed by the final projects students had submitted and decided to revisit
                        my own project from the course with the benefit of a few years of practice. The theme of the project is
                        statistical orbit determination for non-linear orbital dynamics, and includes symplectic Verlet integration 
                        for truth modeling as well as linearized, extended, and unscented Kalman filters (LKF, EKF, & UKF).

                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I became interested in machine learning as an undergraduate, when I began to experiment with simple methods like 
                    genetic algorithms. During my summer with the NASA Frontier Development Lab, I gained some education and hands-on
                    experience with neural networks, and now have some modest experience applying ML in research settings.
                </p>

                    <h3>Myc-Drop</h3>
                    <p class="bm">
                        I wrote the Myc-Drop program specifically for this portfolio. It creates and trains a simple fully-connected 
                        feed-forward network, with architecture and learning parameters set by the user, to classify samples from a  
                        classic mycological data set as either poisonous ("drop") or safe ("keep").
                        <br class="dbr"/>
                        The companion program, "Myc-Check", compares the performance of various choices of architecture and learning 
                        rates, and employs a user-defined weighting scheme for performance metrics.

                    <p class="bm">
                        The Nevermore program is a Poe-etic variation of the classic genetic algorithm problem in which fitness among a 
                        population of strings is determined by the number of characters shared with a target string. The premise is extremely 
                        simple, but I feel it provides an intuitive demonstration of the GA concept.

                <h2>Finite Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    Like filtering algorithms, I learned about the finite element method through my engineering coursework
                    at CU Boulder. I took a course titled "Introduction to Finite Elements" that covered some basic theory,
                    but focused primarily on software applications. I later took a course called "Dynamics of Aerospace 
                    Structures" which covered more of the theoretical background beginning from fundamental concepts like 
                    the principle of virtual work.

                <h2>Lattice Dynamics</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary focus of my research as a graduate student was thermal transport in nanoengineerd semiconductor 
                    matrials. One of the central themes in this research was the study of phonons through lattice dynamics models 
                    which explore the atomistic vibrational properties of materials in a manner similar to the analysis of normal 
                    modes in the field of classical mechanics.
